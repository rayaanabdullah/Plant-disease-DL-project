# Image-Based-Plant-Disease-Classification-Based-On-Deep-Learning-Techniques

Crop diseases pose a significant threat to food security, yet their prompt identification remains challenging in many regions due to the lack of essential infrastructure. The convergence of rising global smart phone penetration and recent strides in computer vision, facilitated by deep learning, has opened avenues for smart phone-assisted disease diagnosis. Leveraging a public dataset comprising 55,562 images of plant leaves with diseases and in healthy conditions collected under controlled settings, we employed a deep convolutional neural network for the identification of 12 crop species, 26 diseases and 1 background pictures with no leaves. The initially trained model demonstrated noteworthy accuracy, achieving 80.1% accuracy. To enhance efficiency, we opted for knowledge distillation, employing a smaller and less complex student model. Through this process, we achieved a close approximation with 78.1% accuracy, incorporating crucial refinements. This underscores the significance of knowledge distillation in refining models, and despite a slight reduction in accuracy; the added nuances contribute substantially to the effectiveness of smart phone-assisted crop disease diagnosis on a global scale.
